blood count,laboratory test that determines the number of red blood cells (erythrocytes) and white blood cells (leukocytes) in a given volume of blood.,None,1,50
bone marrow aspiration,"Direct removal of a small amount (about 1–5 millilitres) of bone marrow by suction through a hollow needle. The needle is usually inserted into the posterior iliac crest of the hip bone in adults and into the upper part of the tibia, the inner, larger bone of the lower leg, in children. Sternal (sternum) bone marrow aspirations are infrequent in modern clinical practice because of risk of injury to the heart, lungs, and great vessels in the chest. The necessity for a bone marrow aspiration is ordinarily based on previous blood studies and is particularly useful in providing information on various stages of maturation and production of blood cells. Disorders in which bone marrow examination is of special diagnostic value include leukemia, multiple myeloma, Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease, and unusual cases of macrocytic and microcytic anemia. Metastatic spread of malignant cells from other organs to the bone marrow may be verified by bone marrow aspiration.",None,1,90.94

cephalin-cholesterol flocculation,"Laboratory test for the nonspecific measurement of blood globulins, a group of proteins that appear in abnormally high concentrations (hyperglobulinemia) in association with certain diseases. The test consists of adding blood serum to a suitably prepared emulsion of cephalin-cholesterol. A flocculent precipitate will form if the serum is abnormally high in globulins. The test is helpful in confirming the presence of liver disease, subacute bacterial endocarditis, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria.",None,1,75
enzyme analysis,"In blood serum, measurement of the activity of specific enzymes in a sample of blood serum, usually for the purpose of identifying a disease. The enzymes normally are concentrated in cells and tissues where they perform their catalytic function; in disease, however, certain enzymes tend to leak into the circulation from the injured cells and tissues.",None,1,149.99
pulmonary function test,"Uused to measure various aspects of the working capacity and efficiency of the lungs and to aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary disease. There are two general categories of pulmonary function tests: (1) those that measure ventilatory function, or lung volumes and the process of moving gas in and out of the lungs from ambient air to the alveoli (air sacs), and (2) those measuring respiratory function, or the transfer of gas between the alveoli and the blood. Tests of ventilatory function include the following measurements: residual volume (RV), air remaining within the chest after a maximal expiration; functional residual capacity (FRC), the resting lung volume, or air within the chest at the end of a quiet expiration; tidal volume, volume of a breath; vital capacity, maximum air volume that can be expelled after a maximum inspiration; and total lung capacity (TLC), air volume within the chest in full inspiration. Except for the residual volume, which is measured by a dilution method, all the other volumes may be recorded with a spirometer; breathing movements may also be registered graphically on a spirogram.",None,1,95.49
uroscopy,"Mmedical examination of the urine in order to facilitate the diagnosis of a disease or disorder. Examining the urine is one of the oldest forms of diagnostic testing, extending back to the days of the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates. Physicians observed the urine to diagnose all forms of illness because direct examination of a patient, or at least disrobing the patient, was socially unacceptable. Until the mid-19th century, uroscopy remained a common method for diagnosing illness. The colour of the urine, as well as cloudiness, precipitates, and particles in the urine, was believed to indicate the cause of the disorder.",None,1,59.99
inulin clearance,"Procedure by which the filtering capacity of the glomeruli (the main filtering structures of the kidney) is determined by measuring the rate at which inulin, the test substance, is cleared from blood plasma. Inulin is the most accurate substance to measure because it is a small, inert polysaccharide molecule that readily passes through the glomeruli into the urine without being reabsorbed by the renal tubules. The steps involved in this measurement, however, are quite involved; consequently, inulin is seldom used in clinical testing, although it is used in research. Creatinine clearance (q.v.) is the more common procedure used to assess renal function. The average rate at which substances are filtered out of the plasma (the glomerular filtration rate) is about 75–115 ml per minute for women and 85–125 ml per minute for men. The rate decreases with age. It is markedly reduced in such conditions as acute glomerulonephritis (also called Bright disease), which is characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels that loop through the glomeruli.",None,1,99.99
urinalysis,"Laboratory examination of a sample of urine to obtain clinical information. Most of the substances normally excreted in the urine are metabolic products dissolved or suspended in water. A deviation from normal in the concentration of urinary constituents or the abnormal presence of specific substances may thus be indicative of bodily disorders. Changes in urine colour, specific gravity, and volume may also provide evidence of a specific disease or body injury.",None,1,49.99
toxicology test,"Group of laboratory analyses that are used to determine the presence of poisons and other potentially toxic agents in blood, urine, or other bodily substances. Toxicology is the study of poisons—their action, their detection, and the treatment of conditions they produce. Many substances are toxic only at high concentrations. For example, lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder but can be toxic at high levels. Another example is acetaminophen, which is valuable in controlling fever and discomfort but is toxic in large doses. ",None,1,60
lumbar puncture,"Also called spinal tap, direct aspiration (fluid withdrawal) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a hollow needle. The needle is inserted in the lower back, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, where the CSF is located.
Lumbar puncture is generally performed to obtain pressure measurements and to withdraw CSF in order to secure a sample of the fluid for cellular, chemical, and bacteriologic examination. In some cases lumbar puncture is used to administer spinal anesthetics or antibiotics or to inject air or a radiopaque or water-soluble contrast medium substance for myelography. Lumbar puncture plays an important role in the diagnosis of certain conditions, including hydrocephalus, meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (leakage of blood into the central nervous system).",None,1,129.99
liver function test,"Because of the diversity of liver function and the varied and complicated metabolic processes that may be affected by disease states, more than 100 tests have been devised to test liver function. These reactions bear upon the metabolism of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, bile, and the detoxification and clearance of drugs and toxic chemicals performed by the liver. Since most of the substances metabolized by the liver enter the systemic circulation, the selective determination of the concentration of some of them in the blood usually gives valuable diagnostic information about a patient’s liver. Urinary values are sometimes also obtained to corroborate blood-serum findings. In clinical practice, some of the more important blood-serum substances are ammonia, urea, amino acids, proteins, free and esterified cholesterol, bilirubin, and various enzymes (notably, cholinesterase, ceruloplasmin, the transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase). In assessing liver metabolism of sugars, tolerance tests are helpful (see glucose tolerance test).",None,1,99.99
kidney function test,"Designed to evaluate various aspects of renal (kidney) capacity and efficiency and to aid in the diagnosis of kidney disorders. Such tests can be divided into several categories, which include (1) concentration and dilution tests, whereby the specific gravity of urine is determined at regular time intervals following water restriction or large water intake, to measure the capacity of the kidneys to conserve water, (2) clearance tests, which give an estimate of the filtration rate of the glomeruli, the principal filtering structures of the kidneys (see inulin clearance), and overall renal blood flow (see phenolsulfonphthalein test), (3) visual and physical examination of the urine, which usually includes the recording of its physical characteristics such as colour, total volume, and specific gravity, as well as checking for the abnormal presence of pus, hyaline casts (precipitation of pure protein from the kidney tubules), and red and white blood cells; proteinuria, the presence of protein in the urine, is often the first abnormal finding indicative of kidney disease, (4) determination of the concentration of various substances in the urine, notably glucose, amino acids, phosphate, sodium, and potassium, to help detect possible impairment of the specific kidney mechanisms normally involved with their reabsorption.",None,1,240.99
gastric fluid analysis,"Medical procedure used to examine the secretions and other liquid substances occurring in the stomach. By means of a tube passed through the nose and into the stomach, gastric fluid can be obtained from the stomach. The most common reason for this test is to look for blood in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Gastric fluid also can be cultured to test for tuberculosis if an adequate sputum sample cannot be obtained for culture.",None,1,139.49
serological test,"Also called serology test or antibody test, any of several laboratory procedures carried out on a sample of blood serum (the clear liquid that separates from the blood when it is allowed to clot) for the purpose of detecting antibodies or antibody-like substances that appear specifically in association with certain diseases. There are different types of serological tests—for example, flocculation tests, neutralization tests, hemagglutinin-inhibition tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and chemiluminescence immunoassays. Among flocculation tests, complement-fixation tests are the most common.",None,1,155.99
hematocrit,"Also spelled haematocrit, diagnostic procedure for the analysis of blood. The name is also used for the apparatus in which this procedure is performed and for the results of the analysis. In the procedure, an anticoagulant is added to a blood sample held in a calibrated tube. The tube is allowed to stand for one hour, after which the sedimentation rate (how rapidly blood cells settle out from plasma) is determined. Most acute generalized infections and some local infections raise the rate of sedimentation. A raised sedimentation rate may be among the first signs of an otherwise hidden disease.",None,1,89.99
glucose tolerance test,"procedure to assess the ability of the body to metabolize glucose, the principal type of sugar found in the blood. In persons with normal or slightly elevated blood-sugar levels, the body tolerance to sugar is measured in a stressful situation induced by administering a large amount of glucose. The most common procedure is to take an initial blood sample from a fasting individual, have the individual empty his or her bladder, and then administer orally 50–100 grams of glucose (usually 1 gram of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight) dissolved in water. Samples of blood and urine for glucose determination are obtained 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours later. Normally the concentration of glucose in the blood will rise to about 140 mg/100 ml within 45–60 minutes and will return in 1 1/2–2 1/2 hours to the normal range of 80–120 mg/100 ml. The most valuable diagnostic point is 2 hours, when the value should be less than 120 mg/100 ml.",None,1,79.59
epinephrine tolerance test,"Assessment of the metabolism of liver glycogen by measuring the blood-sugar response to a standard dose of epinephrine (adrenalin). Epinephrine normally accelerates the conversion of liver glycogen (the conjugated, storage form of glucose) to blood glucose, and a blood-glucose rise of 40–60 mg per 100 ml of blood may be observed within one hour after a subcutaneous injection of epinephrine (usually 0.01 mg per kg [2.2 lb] of body weight), in subjects that have received a high-carbohydrate diet for three days before the test. Individuals with liver disease or with an inherited deficiency of the enzymes that degrade glycogen to glucose show a subnormal response. A modification of the test involves the substitution of a test dose of glucagon for epinephrine (glucagon tolerance test).",None,1,100
